# Jalapeno Infused Tequila

 * Dice two jalapenos per 750ml. Or so... its not important to be exact.
 * Put jalapenos in silver tequila. I use a funnel and jam them in there without touching them.
 * Let sit for two days.
 * Strain out jalapenos. A coffee filter works or a mesh strainer. 

** Exercise caution while handling the peppers or don't touch any valuable body parts afterwards.

** If you have a Costco card get their house brand. It is $20 a handle and is fantastic.
