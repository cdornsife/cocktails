# spicy margarita aka tijuana dumpster fire

 * 2 parts [jalapeno infused tequila](sundry/jalapeno-infused-tequila.md)
 * 1 parts silver tequila
 * 2 parts freshly squeezed lime juice
 * 1 part cointreau
 * 1 part [simple syrup](sundry/simple-syrup.md)

shake with crushed ice or blend.

option:
add some lime pulp. I use a spoon and scrape the pulp out of a spent lime. put the pulp into the glass not the shaker, it will clog the shaker.

pineapple option:
add a chunk or two of pineapple and muddle in target glass. use less lime juice.
